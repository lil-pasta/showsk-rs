# Showsk-rs

Simple blogging/image board project which began as a fork of [LukeMathWalker](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker)'s fantastic zero-2-production series on full stack web-dev in rust. I've deviated quite a bit from his code and scope in several places.

This project is a really great way for me to learn the rust environment, the actix stack, and rust patterns for larger projects.

## Usage

sqlx, docker, and postgresql required to be installed. you may need to make some changes to everything in /conf for your own system (specifically a reminder that your username and password for postrgres should probably not be 'postgres' and 'password')
