# Showsk-rs

Simple blogging project which began as a fork of [LukeMathWalker](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker)'s zero-2-production series on full stack web-dev in rust. 

## Usage

sqlx, docker, and postgresql required to be installed. you may need to make some changes to everything in /conf for your own system (specifically a reminder that your username and password for postrgres should probably not be 'postgres' and 'password')
